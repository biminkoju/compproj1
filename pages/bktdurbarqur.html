        Bhaktapur Durbar Square, locally known as Khwopa Lyaku is the royal palace of the old Bhaktapur Kingdom, 1,400 metres (4,600 ft) above sea level. <br>
        It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Reasonably, it is grounded within the area of 6.52 square miles yet it has numerous temples and wow monuments.

            The Bhaktapur Durbar Square is located in the current town of Bhaktapur, also known as Khwopa, which lies 13 km east of Kathmandu. While the complex consists of at least four distinct squares (Durbar Square, Taumadhi Square, Dattatreya Square and Pottery Square), the whole area is informally known as the Bhaktapur Durbar Square and is a highly visited site in the Kathmandu Valley
