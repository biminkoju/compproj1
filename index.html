          <p>Founded in the 12th century by King Ananda Deva, Bhaktapur served as the capital of Nepal during the first half of Malla Dynasty until the Kingdom split into three in the 15th century. Bhaktapur was a powerful and wealthy independent Newar kingdom under the Malla kings who ruled Bhaktapur from the 15th century to late 18th century before it was annexed into the Gorkha Kingdom. The Malla era was a golden one for Bhaktapur as it was during their reign that art and architecture flourished in Bhaktapur. After its annexation, Bhaktapur lost most of its importance with a halt in development of arts and Bhaktapur remained isolated form the now capital city of Kathmandu and Patan allowing it to remain a homogeneous Newar city. Bhaktapur speaks a distinct dialect of Nepal Bhasa that is closer to the Classical Newar language than the standard form of Nepal Bhasa. <br> Bhaktapur is one of the most visited tourist destination of Nepal. As such it is an important tourist destination in Nepal with the medieval city attracting 301,012 tourists in 2014. Bhaktapur is also notable for its pottery and handicraft industries, and for its rich culture. Due to it's well preserved medieval nature, UNESCO inscribed Bhaktapur as a World Heritage Site since 1979.</p>
