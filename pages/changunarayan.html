                    The ancient Hindu temple of Changu Narayan is located on a
                    high hilltop that is also known as Changu or Dolagiri. The
                    temple was surrounded by champak tree forest and a small
                    village known as Changu. The temple is located in
                    Changunarayan Municipality of Bhaktapur District, Nepal.
                    This hill is about 7 miles or 12 km east of Kathmandu and a
                    few miles north of Bhaktapur. The Manohara River flows
                    beside the hill. This shrine is dedicated to lord Visnu and
                    held in special reverence by the Hindu people. This temple
                    is considered to be the oldest temple in the history of
                    Nepal. The Kashmiri king gave his daughter, Champak, in
                    marriage to the prince of Bhaktapur. Changu Narayan Temple
                    is named after her.
